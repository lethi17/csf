Reflection:
I tried really really hard on the first problem. I kept on trying different ways to draw the graph but I just couldn't get it too look like the example. Even though I knew I was getting close at times, it seems as if the more I worked on it, the nodes were getting all over the place. I tried my best but I that is as far as I got.And then I realize it is not in the right format, so I had to get help from Cardin.
